# csc231_assignment

### For this assignment you have to use the `fibonacci.c` file; the function `generate_fibonacci(int n)` in the file is incomplete. So, you will have to complete the code to make sure that you it takes a decimal value and returns a set of fibonacci values. All the input values will be coming from the file. So, this is a command line input program. The program will read the input file name from command line, and the input file will have a single decimal value between 5 to 10. The program will generate and display fibbonaci sequence based on the value in the file input. For more details please see below:

## Sample input and output
File input 5
```
Fibonacci series of 5 terms:
0 1 1 2 3
```

File input 6
```
Fibonacci series of 6 terms:
0 1 1 2 3 5
```

File input 7
```
Fibonacci series of 7 terms:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8
```

# Notes
- Complete the code for `fibonacci.c` file so that it passes the autograder. 
- No partial points, your code should pass all tests.
- Do not change the text file (i.e., input files). 
- You will receive 0 if you alter the text files even if your code passes the autograder.
